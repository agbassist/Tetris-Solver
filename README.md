# Tetris-Solver

http://people.eecs.ku.edu/~dvermaak/tetris/

If you go to this website and copy and paste my code, you can see it in action.

My tetris-solving algorithm works by calculating every possible position and rotation a tetris piece could land in and calculates a point-value for each of these spots. It then chooses the position and rotation which earns the most points and adjusts the piece accordingly.

Note: After the project was submitted, my submission was used to demonstrate to the class. I found a random seed (included below) which will clear 47 lines, which is one of the highest totals I observed.
